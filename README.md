# Adventure Log

Adventure Log aims to be a simple but useful tool to help trampers (New Zealand slang for _hikers_) better prepare for their trips by surfacing information about the hut, the track or even availability of firewood.

My ethos for web development is _keep it simple, keep it fast_. If you think there is something I can improve, please [open an issue](https://github.com/finnito/adventure-log/issues/new) and let me know!

### Into the Future

- [ ] Post logs to Twitter
- [ ] Post logs to Facebook page
- [ ] Button to flag a log as inappropriate
- [ ] Page describing privacy (tracking etc.)

## Contributing

If you have a feature suggestion, bug report or just want to start a discussion about the goals of the application, please [open an issue](https://github.com/finnito/adventure-log/issues/new)!

I'd love to hear from you, honestly!

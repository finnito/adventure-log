## About

The Blocks module is a content manager that uses drop-in "blocks" of pre-built content.

## Features

- Define static areas of editable blocks; i.e. your footer or sidebar. 
- Use the included blocks field type to add blocks to any streams object like pages or blog posts.  
- Extension based blocks are installable from Control Panel, powered by addons, and 100% override-able/customizable.
